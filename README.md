### Help!

Here you will find the implementation of our Tabs component. The component works like a charm but sadly the code is not so good. We need your help to write modern and well structured code. There is no one perfect solution, the important thing here is to refactor the component until you think it can no longer be improved. We do not expect any change in the behaviour, just improve the code quality and make it a more robust component.

Adding some tests or a storybook would be a plus.

Feel free to take liberties with how you manage the css, typescript, testing, etc...

The goal is to take ownership of the component and show us you prefered component management style.

Thanks for dedicating us your time!

## Changes Made

### Refactoring to Functional Components
Refactored the codebase to use functional React components instead of class components, following modern React best practices.

### Component Breakdown
Split the application into smaller components to separate concerns and improve code organization.

### TypeScript Integration
Introduced TypeScript into the project, adding type definitions, interfaces, and types to enhance code clarity and maintainability.

### Data Loading Simulation
Implemented a custom hook to simulate data loading in the App component, mimicking asynchronous data fetching from an API.

### Test Implementation
Added tests using React Testing Library (RTL) to ensure component functionality and behavior are correctly implemented and maintained.

### CSS Considerations
No changes were made to the CSS styling, as various options such as CSS modules, SASS, or styled-components are available. The focus was on functionality and code structure.

### Tab Component Behavior
While the behavior of the tabs component remained unchanged, the underlying code underwent significant refactoring and improvements to adhere to modern React standards.
